# smart-roster-schedule

## Company Profile
Smart Roster is a startup company created by a group of women (nurses) that want to solve the problem of inefficient scheduling in hospitals. This particular project will be trialled in the NICU at BC Women's Hospital.


## Project Description
The project aim is to develop a web-based application that will match scheduled nurses with a patient assignment, considering variables such as skill set, patient need, and consistency of assignments. The goal would be to reduce time spent creating patient assignments, decrease the number of unintentional errors, and decrease the number of nurses assigned to a patient during their stay. This program would need to be user friendly for a variety of computer literacy levels, have the ability to update in real-time, consider irregular schedules, and meet health authority privacy requirements.
